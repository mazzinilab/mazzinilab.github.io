#### Assistant Professor

<p>Dr. Mazzini started as an Assistant Professor at the Estuary & Ocean Science Center, San Francisco State University, in 2017. He is a coastal physical oceanographer, and his research focuses on understanding how the coastal ocean responds to winds, waves, tides, freshwater input from rivers, and the exchange processes among estuaries, continental shelf, and the deep ocean. His interests go beyond the realms of physical oceanography, and include also the role that ocean currents play on the transport and fate of sediments, oxygen, nutrients, larvae, pH, dispersion of pollutants, and how they impact water quality and the health of marine ecosystem. Understanding how the ocean behaves is key for the proper management of our coasts, especially in a climate change scenario.</p>
<p>The ocean is a complex chaotic system, with three-dimensional properties that vary in time, in intricate and beautiful ways. In his research, Dr. Mazzini uses a combination of different technologies and tools to study the coastal ocean, such as underwater gliders, moorings, shipboard data, satellite remote sensing (sea surface temperature, ocean color, winds, altimetry), High-Frequency land-based radars (measures surface currents), and numerical simulations using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS).

<p> Hobbies: surfing, camping, hiking, rock climbing, brewing, traveling, cooking. </p>

He is an undergraduate student at San Francisco State University and he is interested in studying oceanography of the Gulf of the Farallones and San Francisco Bay. Outside of science and technology he writes short films and shoots nature photography. Having participated in NIH funded programs and science conferences, he knows how to communicate and deliver information as well as use programming languages to create figures.</p>
<p> Practicing various forms of art through science, music, poetry and culture is what he does in his free time. Having grown up in San Francisco gave him his inter-cultural social skills. Having him around will raise team morale and create ways to improve on the protocols, as well as create new protocols where needed.</p>

<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope"></i> <racheljack1@gmail.com> <br />

#### Researcher

<p> Rachel is a student of physical oceanography.  Her current focus of research is the Gulf of the Farallones, in the larger context of the California Current System.</p>
<p> A confluence of interests has brought her to the study of physical oceanography.  Her background is in physical geography and cartography (Bachelor of Arts, UC Berkeley).  As a long-time open water rower on San Francisco Bay she has an intimate understanding of ocean water in motion.  And as an animal care volunteer at The Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, she is witness to the changing patterns in the animals brought to them in need of care, indications of change in the ocean.</p>
<p> Understanding the movements of water and of energy in the oceans is key to understanding the patterns of life and of change.  The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean basin on earth, and we are fortunate to live and work on its eastern boundary. She hopes, through her research, to help better understand the impacts of anthropogenic change on our ocean and on our world.</p>
