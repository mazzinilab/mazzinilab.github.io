### ERTH 795 - Oceanographic Processes in the California Current System (graduate)

**Description:** <br>
Supervised literature review in oceanographic processes in the California Current System (CCS), focusing on coastal physical oceanography and its influence on marine ecosystems and biogeochemistry. Readings, tutorial discussion, and student's presentations. Students are encouraged to bring topics related to their own research to be discussed.

**Learning outcomes:** <br>
Students will gain understanding about coastal physical oceanographic phenomena observed in the CCS, how they relate and influence other aspects of the ocean (e.g. biology, geology, chemistry), and how they may be linked to large-scale oceanic and atmospheric patterns and climate.

**Units:** 3

### ERTH 701 - Research Methods in Geoscience (graduate)

**Learning Objectives and Goals:** <br>
This course is designed to prepare graduate students to write and present the research proposal for their MS thesis, and to prepare them for their subsequent thesis research and writing.

Some specific objectives are to:

* Explore the steps involved in the research process;

* Learn how to conduct effective library searches, organize reference data, and write the background information that is necessary for the project;

* Identify and articulate the research questions;

* Select methods that effectly address the research questions;

* Identify the thesis committee (thesis committee includes the faculty advisor and 2 committee members; 1 can be outside the department);

* Improve ability to write clearly and succinctly;

* Practice presenting information in both written and oral formats;

* Gain information about publishing research and obtaining grants;

* Sharpen critiquing and research evaluation skills;

* Produce a proposal for MS research and choose a thesis committee;

**Units:** 3

### ERTH 434/834 - Coastal Processes (undergraduate/graduate)

**Description:** <br>
The emphasis of this course is on the dynamics of the coastal ocean. Topics include waves, tides, estuaries, continental shelf circulation, and long-term variability (El Nino/La Nina, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, etc.). Course is composed of lectures, lab sessions, field trip, and hands on activities.
The course include an oceanographic cruise on board the R/V Questuary, where students gain real oceanographic field work experience. (Field trip photos can be found [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/photos/coastal_processes/))

**Learning outcomes:** <br>
Students will gain understanding about physical oceanographic processes observed in the coastal ocean, how they relate and influence other aspects of the ocean (e.g. biology, geology, chemistry), and how they may be linked to large-scale oceanic and atmospheric patterns and climate. They also learn basics about collecting, analyzing and interpreting oceanographic data.

**Units:** 3

### ERTH 400 - Earth Systems I (undergraduate)

**Description:** <br>
Exploring the components of Earth's systems: atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere, with focus on the physical and biogeochemical processes through which the components interact.

**Learning outcomes:** <br>
At the end of the course students will be able to:
*	Solve quantitative problems about conservation of mass, energy, and momentum and use those concepts to explain processes within the Earth systems, including using the principles of buoyancy to explain vertical motion in the different Earth systems (ocean, atmosphere, and solid earth)
*	Identify and evaluate Earth systems feedbacks (positive, negative) and how systems respond to perturbations and forcing (stability and equilibrium)
*	Create, interpret, and present results of conceptual and computational models of Earth systems, and demonstrate understanding of the models strengths and limitations.

**Units:** 3

### ERTH 205 - Techniques in Earth Sciences (undergraduate) (co-taugh with Shirin LeClaire)

**Description:** <br>
This course is an introduction to basic field and laboratory techniques in the earth sciences, including scientific writing and research. The course includes the following topics: procedures for collecting and analyzing data in the field and laboratory, presenting technical information in written and oral formats, preparing graphic illustrations, and finding background information. The course also includes discussions of ethical issues, the role of Earth Science in society, and career and educational opportunities. The course uses an active-learning format, where students gain hands-on practice in the field and in the lab using Earth Science techniques. The course includes 2 field trips: a weekend camping in the Point Reyes National Seashore and an oceanographic cruise on board the R/V Questuary. (Field trips photos can be found [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }} /photos/earth_sciences/))

**Objectives:** <br>
The primary objective of this course is to prepare students for upper-division coursework in the Earth Sciences. Whereas most required courses focus on specific content, this course will focus on providing an Earth Science tools and techniques framework within which to place the content. The course also aims to provide an introduction to Earth Science methods for students who are not completing the major but who wish to strengthen their Earth Science background. Through this course students should gain confidence in their ability to use Earth Science tools and to communicate scientific information. All of the course content will be further developed in subsequent majors courses.

Specific objectives are for students to:

* Use online research skills and field techniques to collect and assess basic geoscience data including:

* stratigraphic, petrologic and structural data;

* weather and oceanographic data;

* hydrologic and coastal data

* be able to display this data in graphic form and to present this data clearly;

* be able to interpret scientific graphs, figures, topographic maps, and aerial photographs;

* be able to write clear, accurate reports about observations and interpretations;

* consider societal aspects of Earth Science, including ethics and career opportunities;

* gain practice working with a group to gather data and present results.

**Units:** 2
