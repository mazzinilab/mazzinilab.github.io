  <h4 id="phd-position-at-vims--coastal-physical-oceanography"><strong>PhD position at VIMS â€“ Coastal Physical Oceanography</strong></h4>

  <p>PhD opportunity in coastal physical oceanography is available to work with Dr. Piero Mazzini at William &amp; Maryâ€™s Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS). The position will begin in Fall 2020 or Spring 2021.</p>

  <p><strong>Qualifications:</strong>Â At the time of appointment, the successful candidate will hold an earned Master of Science (M.S.) or equivalent degree inÂ Physical Oceanography, Meteorology, Physics, Environmental Engineering or a related scientific discipline.Â A broad knowledge of physical oceanography and/or fluid dynamicsÂ is required.Â Strong quantitative and programming skills in Python and/or MATLAB and research background with strong writing ability are also required.Â Preference will be given to those candidates with experience in oceanographic data analysis and ocean numerical modeling, especially with the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS).</p>

  <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong>Â The Ph.D. student will work with Dr. Piero Mazzini, and join research projects to investigate topics that may include: river plume dynamics, circulation and dynamics of coastal embayments, effect of complex topography in coastal ocean dynamics, and others. The successful applicant will participate in field work, develop numerical models and perform data analysis.</p>

  <p>Interested candidates should contact Dr. Piero Mazzini at <a href="mailto:pmazzini@vims.edu">pmazzini@vims.edu</a> with information on their research experiences and interests, and current resume/CV.</p>

  <p>Chartered in 1940, theÂ Virginia Institute of Marine ScienceÂ is currently among the largest marine research and education centers in the United States. VIMSÂ has a three-part mission to conduct interdisciplinary research in coastal ocean and estuarine science,Â educate students and citizens, and provide advisory service to policy makers, industry, and the public.

**Dr. Nancy Foster Scholarship Program (NOAA)**: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) offers 4 awards for grad studies in oceanography, marine biology, or maritime archaeology. Students pursing a master's degree are supported for 2 years and those pursuing a doctoral degree are supported for 4 years. Scholarship recipients will attend NOAA Orientation Training in their 1st year in the summer. A 12-month stipend of $30,000 in addition to an education allowance of up to $12,000, and up to $10,000 of support for a 4-6 week program collaboration at a NOAA facility (Total: $42,000 per year). **Open only to U.S. citizens or permanent residents, or citizens of U.S. territories. Women and minority students are particularly encouraged to apply**. Prospective students eligible. Applications due early December. More info at: <a href='https://fosterscholars.noaa.gov/aboutscholarship.html'> Dr. Nancy Scholarship</a>.

**NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program**: Supports outstanding graduate students in NSF-supported science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines who are pursuing research-based Master's and doctoral degrees at accredited United States institutions. Three-year annual stipend of $34,000 along with a $12,000 cost of education allowance for tuition and fees (paid to the institution). The fellowship is competitive, and those planning to apply should devote a sincere effort to their application. **Individuals who are not a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or permanent resident at the time of application are not eligible**. Applications due early October. More info at: <a href='https://www.nsfgrfp.org/'> NSF Graduate Research </a>.

**American Meteorological Society Graduate Fellowships**: The AMS Fellowship Program is a source of unique opportunities for outstanding students looking to pursue graduate education in the atmospheric or related sciences. The program helps these first-year graduate students to be educated about unique challenges facing the world so that they may better tackle real-world issues after graduation. **To be eligible to apply for a fellowship, a student must be: entering their first year of graduate school in the fall and provide evidence of acceptance as a full-time student at an accredited U.S. institution at the time of the award; pursuing a degree in the atmospheric or related sciences; U.S. citizens or hold permanent resident status.** A $25,000 stipend will be presented to each fellowship recipient for a nine-month period in the academic year. Applications due early January.
