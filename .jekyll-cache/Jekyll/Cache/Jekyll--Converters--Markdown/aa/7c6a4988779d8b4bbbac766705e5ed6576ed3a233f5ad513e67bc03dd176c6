  <p><strong>by Dr. Christopher Edwards, UC Santa Cruz</strong></p>

  <p> “Ocean models provide considerable insight into ocean dynamics on a variety of scales and for many types of investigations. Yet, for many unavoidable reasons, models are imperfect.  Ocean data assimilation seeks to improve upon ocean model output by constraining model fields to be more consistent with observations. While physical ocean state estimation has become routine on global and regional scales, biogeochemical data assimilation is less mature. I’ll report on our efforts to constrain modeled biological states using satellite estimates of sea surface chlorophyll. I’ll discuss an application of these data assimilative estimates, namely to probe changes in primary production during the recent blob and El Niño episodes in the California Current System, and better understand the reasons for the changes.”</p>

  <p> “Christopher Edwards is a Professor in the Ocean Sciences Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He received his BS from Haverford College in 1988 and his PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 1997. He was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and a research scientist at the University of Connecticut before becoming a faculty member at UC Santa Cruz in 2002.”</p>

  <p> The <a href="http://rtc.sfsu.edu/rosenberg/index.htm">Barbara and Richard Rosenberg Institute for Marine Biology and Environmental Science Seminar Series</a> brings leading local, national, and international scientists to a public forum at EOS Center to speak about the latest advances in science. Seminars are free and open to the general public. The seminars schedule can be found <a href="http://rtc.sfsu.edu/seminar/index.htm">here</a> </p>

  <p>The Seminar Series is supported by generous contributions from the Barbara and Richard M. Rosenberg Institute at the EOS Center, San Francisco State University. </p>

  <p> Note: All seminars are held <strong>Wednesdays at 3:30 p.m. in the Bay Conference Center (BCC)</strong> unless otherwise noted. Please enter through the 3152 Paradise Drive driveway.</p>
