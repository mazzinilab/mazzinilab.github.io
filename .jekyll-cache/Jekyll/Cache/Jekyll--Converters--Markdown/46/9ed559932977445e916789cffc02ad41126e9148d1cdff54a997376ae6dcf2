    <p> <strong>CP015 - The dynamics of buoyancy-driven flows in estuaries, continental shelves and polar seas</strong></p>

    <p>Freshwater entering estuaries and the coastal ocean influences physical and biogeochemical processes that take place at the interface between terrestrial and oceanic environments. Understanding the mixing and dynamics of these flows is key to predict how materials and substances are delivered to continental shelves and the deep ocean, and how they may impact marine ecosystems. The dynamics of buoyancy-driven flows are complex and influenced by several factors, including freshwater discharge, winds, waves, tides, ambient currents, stratification, and bathymetry. Hydrodynamics in these systems profoundly impacts the regional-scale ecological and biogeochemical processes in addition to various physical processes such as sediment transport and ocean-cryosphere interactions. The multi-scale nature of these flows provides great challenges from both an observational and modeling standpoint. Modern technological advances have allowed recent progress in monitoring and understanding the dynamics of these flows, which are fundamental for the proper management of ecologically and socially relevant coastal regions. We welcome submissions that investigate the wide spectrum of scales of buoyancy-driven flows in estuaries, continental shelves, and polar regions, using observational, numerical, remote sensing, laboratory, and theoretical approaches. </p>
