	<li><h3> Circulation and mixing of river plumes</h3>
	<div style="text-align:justify">
	<p>During my postdoc at Rutgers University, I worked with Dr. Robert J. Chant and Dr. John Wilkin, doing in situ observations (moorings, hydrography, turbulence, Wirewalkers) and developing a high-resolution realistic numerical model using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), as a member of Rutgers' Ocean Modeling Group. I worked on two different projects located off the coasts of New Jersey, and Virginia/North Carolina, focusing on advancing our understanding of the circulation and mixing of coastal trapped river plumes:</p></div>

	<p>During my PhD at Oregon State University, I worked under the supervision of Dr. John A. Barth, as part of the Glider Research Group. I worked on different projects, investigating the role of river discharge and wind-forcing in the dynamics of the continental shelf:</p></div>
