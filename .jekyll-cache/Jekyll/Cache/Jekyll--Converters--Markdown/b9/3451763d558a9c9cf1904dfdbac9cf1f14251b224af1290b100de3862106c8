    <p>The students from the Techniques in Earth Sciences class went on 2 field trips: a weekend camping in the Point Reyes National Seashore and an oceanographic cruise to the San Francisco Bay on board the R/V Questuary. On this cruise, we measured currents, temperature, salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll in this urbanized estuary. The photos from the 2 trips can be found <a href="/photos/earth_sciences/">here</a>.</p>
