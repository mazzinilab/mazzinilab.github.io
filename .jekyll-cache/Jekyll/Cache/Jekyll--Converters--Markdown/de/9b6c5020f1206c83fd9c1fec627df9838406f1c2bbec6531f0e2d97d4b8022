    <p>Below is the Dr. Mazzini interview:</p>

    <p> <i>  The chance to cross over traditional boundaries is what attracted Assistant Professor of Earth &amp; Climate Sciences Piero Mazzini to the EOS Center. “Here, I get to interact with biologists and chemists. I get to see how the physics of the ocean applies to other areas of knowledge.” </i> </p>

    <p> <i> Mazzini specializes in the study of the physical properties of the ocean, especially its currents — and since joining the Center in 2017, he’s dived into interdisciplinary work. A graduate student in his lab, Bianca Bahman, is working on the intersection between physical processes in the ocean and shark behavior, and Mazzini is also collaborating with Adjunct Professor of Biology Richard Dugdale to study the nutrients carried by a major current that runs along the California coast. </i> </p>

    <p> <i> He’s also working with a long-running dataset to understand the surface currents that connect San Francisco Bay to the ocean. This work is important to understanding how climate change might influence the Bay since a changing climate will alter both the chemistry of the ocean and the wind patterns that drive ocean circulation.” </i> </p>
