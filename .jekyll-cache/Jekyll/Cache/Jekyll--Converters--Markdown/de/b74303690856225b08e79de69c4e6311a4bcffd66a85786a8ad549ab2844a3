    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>:
Ocean acidification along the California Shelf is controlled by the upwelling of deep CO2 -rich waters.
This coastal upwelling is driven by along-shore winds, which vary seasonally. We report aragonite
undersaturation based on proxy values derived from temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen data
and show the relationship between the spatial extent of low aragonite saturation state values and
upwelling-favorable along-shore winds. Our data were collected on seasonal hydrographic surveys
off northern California that span several years. Transect data show a persistent spatial pattern with
shoaling of the aragonite saturation horizon over the shelf (during May and July surveys, mean depth
of horizon is less than 20 m within âˆ¼20 km of the coast), and surfacing of the saturation horizon
during times of strong upwelling events. Our model shows that a higher proportion of the water
column is undersaturated in aragonite when northerly winds are stronger. In addition, we found that
pteropod abundance was positively correlated with aragonite saturation state, with lower densities
associated with lower saturation values. If upwelling-favorable winds increase with global warming,
as anticipated, more shelf water habitat will become undersaturated in aragonite, negatively impacting
populations of calcifying organisms like pteropods.
