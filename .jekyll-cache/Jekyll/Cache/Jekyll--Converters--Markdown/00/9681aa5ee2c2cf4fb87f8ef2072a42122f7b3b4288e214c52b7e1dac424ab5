    <p>The Coastal Oceanography Lab is participating in the Project:</p>

    <p> <b>“Using Saildrone autonomous in situ data for satellite validation and research into upper ocean physics and ecology”</b> </p>

    <p> The project is led by the principal investigator Dr. Chelle Gentemann from Earth and Space Research (‘ESR’) and brings together other 23 scientists from established research institutions, universities, and government agencies. With funding from the Schmidt Family Foundation, a Saildrone was deployed on April 11th, 2018 for a 60-day cruise, and will be transiting between San Francisco and Acapulco, Mexico. </p>

    <p> The scientific objectives include studies of upwelling dynamics, air-sea interactions including frontal regions, diurnal warming regions, river plume dynamics, and ocean ecology. The validation objectives include establishing the utility of Saildrone measurements for inclusion into ocean models, validation of glider observations, and validation of satellite-derived fluxes, sea surface temperatures, ocean currents, and wind vectors.</p>
