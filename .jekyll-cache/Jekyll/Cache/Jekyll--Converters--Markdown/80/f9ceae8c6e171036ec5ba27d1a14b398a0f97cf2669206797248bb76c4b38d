    <p>The students from my Coastal Processes class went on a field trip to the San Francisco Bay on board of the R/V Questuary. We measured currents, temperature, salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll in this urbanized estuary. The photos from this trip can be found <a href="/photos/coastal_processes/">here</a>.</p>
