  <p> Dr. Phil Bresnahan and other scientists from Smartfin have sent a unit to the Coastal Oceanography Lab (COLAB). </p>

  <p> This new technology will be used to collect data for research and educational purposes in coastal and estuarine environments. </p>

  <p> A Stand Up Paddle board (SUP) will be made available soon at the COLAB for students who would like to help with data collection. </p>
