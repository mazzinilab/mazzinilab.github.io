  <p> The Smartfin team, including Drs. Phil Bresnahan & Tyler Cyronak of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, have sent a unit to the Coastal Oceanography Lab (COLAB). This new technology will be used to collect data for research and educational purposes in coastal and estuarine environments. A Stand Up Paddle board (SUP) will be made available soon at the COLAB for students who would like to help with data collection. </p>

  <p> For more information on this new technology please refer to  <a href='https://smartfin.org/'> smartfin.org </a> and <a href='https://supscience.com/smartfin/'> supscience.com/smartfin </a> </p>
