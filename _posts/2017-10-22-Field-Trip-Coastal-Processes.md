The students from my Coastal Processes class went on a field trip to the San Francisco Bay on board of the R/V Questuary. We measured currents, temperature, salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll in this urbanized estuary. The photos from this trip can be found [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/photos/coastal_processes/).
